>Important notes: For HTTP with Javascript, I implement both fetch and XMLHTTPRequest. You can select the corresponding radio box to choose the method you want to use. For extra credit, I use two frameworks. The first one is vue. The second one is a UI library framework called ElementUI. I use button component and icon component from that library.
